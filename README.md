## How to install?

### Resource Pack

1. Place it in the ```.minecraft/resourcepacks```.
2. Activate it before starting the game.

### Datapack

1. When creating a world, open the "More" tab, select "Data Packs".
2. Open the Data Packs folder, copy and paste the downloaded datapack there.
3. When the world loads, access the commands and type the command `/reload`

> For an already created world, the datapack can be placed at ```.minecraft/saves/(Ваш мир)/datapacks/```, for example for updates. To apply the changes, repeat step 4.
