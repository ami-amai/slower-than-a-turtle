# Slower That a Turtle Hardcore Datapack
## Introduction
This is my first publicly released Minecraft datapack. It’s a work in progress, but I aim to eventually shape it into the experience I’ve imagined.
## About the datapack
The datapack offers a new survival experience in a hardcore world, focused on slow, deliberate progression and a real hardcore feel—without overwhelming complexity or unnecessary challenges. The game also requires a resource pack, which is essential for gameplay as it includes elements that cannot be implemented through the datapack alone.
